    "One of the hobbies I picked up during the COVID-19 pandemic was getting together weekly with some friends over Zoom to play Dungeons and Dragons. It was a game none of us had played before, however some were fans of shows on YouTube and had some idea of what they were doing.\n",

    "For the newbies like myself, using the site [D&D Beyond] (https://www.dndbeyond.com/) was extremely helpful in building my character, tracking it's progress, and even rolling the dice! (I now have 3 sets of dice which does make the game more fun!)\n",

    "D&D Beyond has many features. One of which can track your currency. It also will calculate all the different coins into one standard coin (gold pieces) so you can get an idea of how much you have."
